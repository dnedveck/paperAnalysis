renamed the csv to `Barrett2014.csv`, and `README.txt` to `metadata.txt`

I made a csv that added more variables based on the bact.trt in Barrett2014.csv

rhiz.strain = strain ID from their `metadata.txt`
rhiz.genus = the genus/genera of the inoculant, and mix where they are mixed
bact.dv = the number of different genera present
