## fitting some models

### Does nodulation level affect the amount of plant biomass?

Simple model of plant weight explained by the amount of nodulation
```{r}
# nodulation should be a factor, as it's nodulation score
lm.nodulation <- lm(Wt ~ as.factor(nodulation), data = barrett.df)
plot(lm.nodulation, which = c(1:2))
```

They did a log transform of their data, since it is definitely not normal. So let's fit a model with that:
```{r}
lm.logwt.nodulation <- lm(log(Wt) ~ as.factor(nodulation), data = barrett.df)
plot(lm.logwt.nodulation, which=c(1:2))
```
