# Analysis of data from published papers

This is where I am keeping how I am analysing data from papers. I've downloaded and wrangled the data in the respective `/data` directory, and analysis is in `/analysis` folders. 

See the `README.md` in each `/data` directory to see how I retreived and modified the data to get it ready for analysis.
