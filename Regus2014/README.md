# Regus2014 data analysis

Playing around with the data published in the Regus2014 paper: [Link to the paper here](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1781/20132587)

I took the data from the supplementary data (which was a bunch of tables in a word doc, gross), pasted into google docs, exported as .tsv and cleaned it up to bring into R. The data is in `./data/`

I'm tooling around with the data and creating reports with `knitr`. Those are in `./analysis`.
